       "    'text': \"To implement the scoring algorithm efficiently in Python, we can use data structures like dictionaries and sets to optimize the time complexity. Here's an example implementation:\\n\\n```python\\ndef score_words(words, char_scores):\\n    # Create a dictionary to store the score for each character\\n    char_score_dict = {char: score for char, score in char_scores.items()}\\n\\n    # Create a set to store unique characters in the word list\\n    unique_chars = set(''.join(words))\\n\\n    # Calculate the score for each word\\n    word_scores = {}\\n    for word in words:\\n        word_score = sum(char_score_dict[char] for char in set(word))\\n        word_scores[word] = word_score\\n\\n    # Sort the words based on their scores in descending order\\n    sorted_words = sorted(word_scores.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))\\n\\n    return sorted_words\\n```\\n\\nHere's how the `score_words` function works:\\n\\n1. First, we create a dictionary `char_score_dict` that maps each character to its corresponding score. This allows us to look up the score for a character in constant time O(1).\\n\\n2. Next, we create a set `unique_chars` that contains all the unique characters present in the word list. This is done by joining all the words into a single string and then converting it into a set. This step takes O(n) time, where n is the total length of all words.\\n\\n3. We then iterate over each word and calculate its score by summing the scores of its unique characters. This is done by converting the word into a set to get its unique characters and then looking up their scores in the `char_score_dict`. The time complexity of this step is O(k * m), where k is the length of the word, and m is the number of unique characters in the word.\\n\\n4. After calculating the score for each word, we store the word and its score in a dictionary `word_scores`.\\n\\n5. Finally, we sort the `word_scores` dictionary based on the scores in descending order and the words in lexicographical order (in case of ties). This is done using the `sorted` function with a custom key function that first sorts based on the negative score (to get descending order) and then based on the word itself. The time complexity of this step is O(n log n), where n is the number of words.\\n\\nThe overall time complexity of the `score_words` function is O(n * m + n log n), where n is the total length of all words, and m is the maximum length of a word. This is because the most time-consuming steps are creating the `unique_chars` set (O(n)) and calculating the score for each word (O(k * m), where k is the length of the word).\\n\\nNote that this implementation assumes that the `char_scores` dictionary is provided as input and that the scores for all characters are non-negative integers.\"}]},\n",
